# Random Forest VS Artificial Neural Network Multilayer Perceptron
University Trier - Multivariate Statistics Subject - Project

# Summary of the Project

This project defines the technique of the machine learning models in terms of the predicting modeling for the event of rain in Madrid Spain. For the prediction of the event rain
Random Forest (RF) and Artificial Neural Network Multilayer Perceptron (ANN-MLP) models were applied, and models are established by Max Temperature, Min Temperature, Max Dewpoint,
Min Humidity, and Min Sea Level Pressure. The aim of this paper is to predict the rain event with machine learning models and also a comparison of models with performance
measures. To construct the model 18 years of daily weather data (1997-2015) of Madrid Spain has been used, and divided 80% data as a training set to learn the model and 20% for
the testing set. Also, the performance measures such as Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F-Score, and ROC (AUC) exhibits that ANN-MLP performs better.
